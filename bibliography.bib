The conservation equations and the constitutive relation are solved simultaneously by Galerkin finite element and Newton iteration. This combination eliminates the necessity for tracking yield surfaces in the flow field. The analysis is applied to a one‐dimensional channel flow, a two‐dimensional boundary layer flow, and a two‐dimensional extrusion flow. The finite element predictions compare well with available analytic solutions for limiting cases.},

The stabilization procedure involves a slightly modified Galerkin/least-squares formulation of the steady-state equations. The pressure field is interpolated by continuous functions for both the quadrilateral and triangular elements used. These elements are employed in conjunction with the one-step and multi-step time integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. The three test cases chosen for the performance evaluation of these formulations are the standing vortex problem, the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds number 400, and flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number 100.}
